  environment: 'PRODUCTION', // or 'SANDBOX' for testing
  scope: 'https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope',
};

// OAuth 2.0 Implementation
class EbayAPIService {
  constructor(config) {
    this.config = config;
    this.rateLimiter = new RateLimiter(100000, 86400000); // 100k calls per day
    this.accessToken = null;
    this.tokenExpiry = null;
  }

  async authenticate() {
    // OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow
    const response = await fetch('https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
        'Authorization': `Basic ${Buffer.from(`${this.config.clientId}:${this.config.clientSecret}`).toString('base64')}`
      },
      body: 'grant_type=client_credentials&scope=https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope'
    });
    
    const data = await response.json();
    this.accessToken = data.access_token;
    this.tokenExpiry = Date.now() + (data.expires_in * 1000);
  }

  async searchItems(keywords, categoryId = null) {
    await this.ensureValidToken();
    await this.rateLimiter.waitForToken();
    
    const searchParams = new URLSearchParams({
      q: keywords,
      limit: 50,
      fieldgroups: 'MATCHING_ITEMS,EXTENDED'
    });
    
    if (categoryId) {
      searchParams.append('category_ids', categoryId);
    }

    const response = await fetch(`https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?${searchParams}`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.accessToken}`,
        'X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID': 'EBAY_US'
      }
    });

    return await response.json();
  }

  async getItemDetails(itemId) {
    await this.ensureValidToken();
    await this.rateLimiter.waitForToken();
    
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item/${itemId}`, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${this.accessToken}`,
        'X-EBAY-C-MARKETPLACE-ID': 'EBAY_US'
      }
    });

    return await response.json();
  }

  async ensureValidToken() {
    if (!this.accessToken || Date.now() >= this.tokenExpiry) {
      await this.authenticate();
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Processing and Analysis
```javascript
// Educational Pattern Analysis
class EbayEducationalAnalyzer {
  constructor(apiService) {
    this.api = apiService;
  }

  async analyzeUserSubmission(userScreenshot, userProductInfo) {
    try {
      // Search for similar items based on user-provided information
      const searchResults = await this.api.searchItems(userProductInfo.title);
      
      // Analyze patterns for educational insights
      const insights = {
        priceComparison: this.analyzePricePatterns(searchResults),
        sellerPatterns: this.analyzeSellerPatterns(searchResults),
        listingQuality: this.analyzeListingQuality(searchResults),

      console.error('eBay analysis error:', error);
      return { error: 'Unable to complete educational analysis' };
    }
  }

  analyzePricePatterns(results) {
    // Educational price analysis logic
    const prices = results.itemSummaries?.map(item => item.price?.value) || [];
    return {
      average_market_price: this.calculateAverage(prices),
      price_distribution: this.analyzePriceDistribution(prices),

      username: item.seller?.username,
      feedbackPercentage: item.seller?.feedbackPercentage,
      feedbackScore: item.seller?.feedbackScore
    })) || [];

    return {
