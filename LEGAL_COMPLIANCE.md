# Legal Compliance Guide for Shop Scan Pro

## ‚öñÔ∏è Critical Legal Considerations

### üö® **HIGH RISK ACTIVITIES TO AVOID**

1. **Direct Web Scraping of Protected Sites**
   - Many platforms explicitly prohibit scraping in Terms of Service
   - Can violate Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
   - Risk of IP blocking and legal action

2. **Definitive Authenticity Claims**
   - Never claim to definitively determine if products are "fake" or "counterfeit"
   - Avoid absolute statements about product quality
   - Don't make claims that could constitute defamation

3. **Using Copyrighted Content**
   - Product images are typically copyrighted
   - Product descriptions may be copyrighted
   - Company logos/trademarks cannot be used without permission

### ‚úÖ **LEGALLY SAFER APPROACHES**

1. **Opinion-Based Analysis**
   - Frame all assessments as "analysis suggests" or "our opinion"
   - Use probabilistic language ("likely," "appears to be," "may indicate")
   - Emphasize that analysis is for informational purposes only

2. **User-Submitted URLs Only**
   - Only analyze URLs submitted by users
   - Don't crawl or scrape sites automatically
   - Let users provide the information to analyze

3. **Fair Use Compliance**
   - Minimal reproduction of content for analysis purposes
   - Clear educational/consumer protection purpose
   - Add original analysis and commentary

### üõ°Ô∏è **RECOMMENDED LEGAL PROTECTIONS**

1. **Enhanced Disclaimers** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
   ```
   - "Analysis for informational purposes only"
   - "Not affiliated with any platforms mentioned"
   - "Users responsible for verification"
   - "No guarantees of accuracy"
   ```

2. **Defensive Language Changes** ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
   ```
   BEFORE: "Platform known for quality issues"
   AFTER: "Our analysis suggests additional verification recommended"
   
   BEFORE: "Dropshipped product detected"
   AFTER: "Analysis indicates potential dropship characteristics"
   ```

3. **API-First Approach** ‚ö†Ô∏è RECOMMENDED
   - Use official APIs where available
   - Respect rate limits and terms
   - Get explicit permission for data use

4. **Terms of Service Updates** üìã NEEDED
   - Clear user agreement
   - Limitation of liability
   - Indemnification clauses
   - Dispute resolution terms

### üîç **SPECIFIC PLATFORM CONSIDERATIONS**

- Consider applying for API access

- Unauthorized scraping prohibited

#### Etsy

### üìã **IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS**

### üí° **ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES**

   - Provide checklists and guides
   - Reduce automated assessment
